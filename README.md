# wox_youtube_plugin
A Plugin for Wox to search and display youtube results. It allows you to search the top n youtube videos results via the wox searchbox and open the one you're interested in.

The following syntax is used:
yt [query [order by {date|rating|relevance|title|videoCount|viewCount}]] | --config].
The []-brackets symbolize that this is optional, the pipe (a|b) means use either a or b for your query.

To have a youtube logo displayed while searching, add one to the wox_youtube Plugin folder and rename it to icon.png. I do not include one due to copyright.
